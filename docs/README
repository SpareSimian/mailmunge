DESCRIPTION
-----------

Mailmunge is an email filtering tool that uses the Milter library to
interface with either Sendmail or Postfix.  The milter interface then
uses its own protocol to interface with a Perl program; this permits
you to write your mail filtering policies in Perl rather than C.
Additionally, the Perl worker processes are single-threaded (unlike the
multithreaded milter library) which greatly simplifies the coding.
