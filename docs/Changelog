2020-07-30 Dianne Skoll <dianne@skollsoft.com>

	* Add Mailmunge::Filter::action_from_response helper function.
	  If appropriate, it calls an action_* function based on a
	  Mailmunge::Response object.  See docs for details.

	* Add support for running regression tests against Rocky Linux 8
	  as well as Debian 10.  Both Sendmail and Postfix are tested.

	* Add support for Rspamd (https://rspamd.com/).  We do not use
	  the rspamc client; instead, we talk directly to the daemon using
	  its native HTTP protocol.

	* Put GPLv2 license markers in all files

	* Use -fPIE rather than -fPIC when building executables

	* Get rid of --enable-cleanup-with-rm

	* Include a sample /etc/default/mailmunge file

	  multiplexor if it looks like the filter is completely broken.
