=head1 NAME

mailmunge-multiplexor - Process pool controller for mail filters.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

   mailmunge-multiplexor [options]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<mailmunge-multiplexor> manages a pool of Perl processes for
scanning e-mail.  It is designed to work in conjunction with
C<mailmunge> and your Perl filter program.

C<mailmunge-multiplexor> opens a UNIX-domain socket and listens for
requests for work from C<mailmunge>.  As requests come in,
C<mailmunge-multiplexor> creates Perl processes as needed to scan
mail.  The Perl processes are not killed when scanning is completed, but
continue to run in a loop.  Perl processes are re-used for subsequent
e-mail messages.  This eliminates the large overhead of starting a
new Perl process for each incoming message.

To avoid memory leaks, the Perl processes are killed after they have handled
some number of scans.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over

=item -U I<user>

Runs the multiplexor as I<user> rather than I<root>.  This
option is mandatory, and must match the C<-U> option supplied
to C<mailmunge>.

=item -m I<minWorkers>

The minimum number of Perl processes to keep running at all times.  The
default is zero.

=item -x I<maxWorkers>

The maximum number of Perl processes to run simultaneously.  If a
request comes in and all processes are busy, a temporary failure
is signalled to the SMTP peer.  The default is 2.

=item -r I<maxRequests>

The maximum number of requests a given process handles before it is killed
and a replacement started.  The default is 500.

=item -i I<idleTime>

The idle time in seconds after which to kill of excess Perl processes.
That is, if the process is idle for longer than this time, and there
are more than I<minWorkers> running, the process is killed.  Note that
this is implemented as a timer that ticks every I<idleTime> seconds;
therefore, processes may be idle for up to twice this time before they
are killed.  The default for I<idleTime> is 300 seconds.

=item -V I<maxLifetime>

The maximum lifetime in seconds of a worker before it is killed and a
replacement started.  The default is -1, which signifies no maximum
lifetime.  Note that the lifetime check is done only when a worker
becomes idle after a request, or every time the idle-timeout check is
made.  On a very quiet system, workers may live for longer than
I<maxLifetime> by as much as I<idleTime>.  Note also that the
lifetime is measured not from when the worker started running, but
from when it was assigned its very first request.  A completely-idle
worker that has never processed any requests will not be terminated by
the I<maxLifetime> setting.

=item -b I<busyTime>

The longest a Perl process is allowed to spend scanning an e-mail before
it is declared hung up and killed.  The default is 120 seconds.

=item -Z

This option specifies that the multiplexor should accept and process
"status updates" from busy workers.  Note that this consumes one extra
file descriptor per worker, plus a small amount of CPU time per status
update.

=item -c I<cmdTime>

The timeout for communication between
C<mailmunge-multiplexor> and C<mailmunge>, or between
C<mailmunge-multiplexor> and a Perl scanning process.  The
default is 10 seconds.  This timeout should be kept quite short.

=item -w I<waitTime>

When C<mailmunge-multiplexor> starts the initial workers, or needs
to bring the number of running workers up to the number defined by the
C<-m> option, it does not start all the workers at once, because this
could overload your server.  Instead, it starts one worker every
I<waitTime> seconds.  The default value for I<waitTime> is 3.

=item -W I<waitTime>

If you use this option, C<mailmunge-multiplexor> will I<never>
activate a worker until I<waitTime> seconds have elapsed since the
last worker activation.  This could result in mail being tempfailed
if worker activations do not keep pace with incoming mail.  However,
it may be preferable to tempfail mail rather than allow the load
on your server to spike up too quickly.  The default value for this
option is 0, meaning that C<mailmunge-multiplexor> will start
workers as quickly as necessary to keep up with incoming mail.

=item -z I<spooldir>

Set the spool directory to I<spooldir>.  If this option is omitted,
the spool directory defaults to @SPOOLDIR@.

=item -s I<pathName>

The UNIX-domain socket on which
C<mailmunge-multiplexor> listens for requests.  This should be
specified as an absolute pathname.  If this option is not supplied,
it defaults to F<mailmunge-multiplexor.sock> under the spool directory.

=item -a I<socket>

A socket for listening for requests.  This is similar to the C<-s>
socket, except that a restricted set of requests are processed.  On
this socket, the multiplexor will only process requests asking for
status; it will not accept any commands to do scanning or that would
consume a worker.  See the L<SOCKET SPECIFICATION> section for the format
of I<socket>.

=item -p I<fileName>

Causes C<mailmunge-multiplexor> to write its process-ID (after
becoming a daemon) to the specified file.  The file will be owned
by root.

=item -o I<fileName>

Causes C<mailmunge-multiplexor> to use I<fileName> as a lock
file to avoid multiple instances from running.  If you supply
C<-p> but not C<-o>, then C<mailmunge-multiplexor>
constructs a lock file by appending ".lock" to the pid file.  However,
this is less secure than having a root-owned pid file in a root-owned
directory and a lock file writable by the user named by the C<-U>
option.  (The lock file must be writable by the C<-U> user.)

=item -f I<filter_path>

Normally, C<mailmunge-multiplexor> executes a Perl filter script
called C<@CONFDIR_EVAL@/mailmunge-filter.pl> to scan the e-mail.
However, you can have it execute any program you like by specifying
the full path to the program with the C<-f> option.  This program
must obey the protocol documented in L<mailmunge-protocol>; see
that manual page for details.

=item -l

Log certain events, including the output of the Perl workers'
standard-error, using syslog.  Normally, the multiplexor does not log
much information.

=item -d

Write debugging information about event-handling code in
/var/log/mailmunge-event-debug.log.  This is only of use to people
debugging C<mailmunge-multiplexor>.

=item -R I<kbytes>

Limits the resident-set size of the worker filter processes to
I<kbytes> kilobytes.  This limit is not supported on all operating
systems; it is known to work on Linux.

=item -M I<kbytes>

Limits the total memory space of worker filter processes to
I<kbytes> kilobytes.  This limit is supported on all operating
systems that support the setrlimit system call.  This should
include most modern UNIX systems.

We recommend that you monitor your worker filter processes and get a feel
for how much memory they use.  You should then limit the memory to
two or three times the worst-case that you have observed.  This can
help mitigate denial-of-service attacks that use complicated MIME
messages to force your Perl filter to consume lots of memory.

=item -h

Print usage information and exit.

=item -t I<filename>

Log statistical information to I<filename>.  See the section
L</STATISTICS> for more information.

=item -T

Log statistical information using C<syslog>.  You may use C<-t> and
C<-T> together, in which case statistical information is logged in a
file and using C<syslog>.

=item -u

Flush the statistics file after every write.  Normally,
C<mailmunge-multiplexor> does not flush the file; this is the best choice
for minimizing disk I/O on a busy mail server.  However, if you wish to
watch statistics entries in real-time, you should enable flushing.

=item -D

Do not fork into the background and become a daemon.  Instead, stay
in the foreground.  Useful mainly for debugging or if you have a
supervisory process such as C<systemd> managing C<mailmunge-multiplexor>.

=item -q I<queue_size>

Normally, if all workers are busy and C<mailmunge-multiplexor> receives
another request, it fails it with the error "No free workers."  However,
if you use the C<-q> option, then up to I<queue_size> requests
will be queued.  As soon as a worker becomes free, the queued requests
will be handed off in FIFO order.  If the queue is full and another request
comes in, then the request is failed with "No free workers".

=item -Q I<queue_timeout>

Queued requests should not stay on the queue indefinitely.  If a queued
request cannot be processed within I<queue_timeout> (default 30) seconds
of being placed on the queue, it is failed with a "Queued request timed out"
message.  See the section L<QUEUEING REQUESTS> for more discussion.

=item -O I<sock>

Listen on a I<notification socket> for connections from I<listeners>.
C<mailmunge-multiplexor> can inform external programs of state
changes by sending messages over a notification socket.  The external
programs connect to this socket and then listen for notifications.  See
the section L<SOCKET SPECIFICATION> for the format of I<sock>.

See the L<mailmunge-notify> man page for details of the notification
protocol.

=item -N I<map_sock>

Listen on a I<map socket> for Sendmail SOCKETMAP connections.
As of Sendmail 8.13, you can define a Sendmail map type that talks
to a daemon over a socket.  C<mailmunge-multiplexor> implements
that protocol; see L<Mailmunge::Filter/filter_map> for details.

See the section L<SOCKET SPECIFICATION> for the format of I<map_sock>.

=item -I I<backlog>

When C<mailmunge-multiplexor> creates a listening socket, it
calculates the "backlog" argument to C<listen> based on the
maximum number of workers.  However, you can explicitly set this
backlog with the C<-I> option.  Setting the backlog to a high
value (around 30-50) may help on a very busy server.  If you see mail
log messages saying "MXCommand: socket: Connection refused" during
busy periods, then that's an indication you need a higher listen
backlog.

=item -L I<interval>

Log the worker status every I<interval> seconds.  This logs a line using
syslog; the line looks like this:

    Worker status: Stopped=s Idle=i Busy=b Killed=k Queued=q Msgs=m Activations=a

Here, "Stopped" is the number of non-running workers, "Idle" is the
number of idle workers, "Busy" is the number of busy workers, "Killed"
is the number of killed workers yet to be reaped, "Queued" is the
number of queued requests, "Msgs" is the total number of messages
processed since the multiplexor began running, and "Activations" is
the number of times a Perl process has been started since the
multiplexor began running.

If you supply an I<interval> of 0 (which is the default), no periodic
status logging is performed.  If you supply an I<interval> of less than
5 seconds, it is silently reset to 5 seconds.

=item -S I<facility>

Specifies the syslog facility for log messages.  The default is
I<mail>.  See C<openlog> for a list of valid facilities.
You can use either the short name ("mail") or long name ("LOG_MAIL") for
the facility name.

=item -E

Specifies that the multiplexor should create an embedded Perl interpreter.
This can improve performance dramatically.  But see the section
L<EMBEDDING PERL> for more information.

=item -X I<n>

Specifies that the multiplexor should initiate a "tick" request every
I<n> seconds.  This causes your I<filter_tick> function (if defined)
to be called.  Note that you have no control over which worker executes
I<filter_tick>.  If all workers are busy when a tick occurs,
that tick request is skipped and a warning message is logged.

=item -P I<n>

Specifies that the multiplexor should run I<n> tick requests in
parallel.  Each tick is run as often as specified with the
C<-X> argument.  (If you omit the C<-P> option, then the
multiplexor behaves as if C<-P 1> had been specified.)

If you run parallel ticks, each tick is assigned an integer
identifying its "type".  The type ranges from 0 to I<n>-1.  While
there may be as many as I<n> tick requests running at a time, only
one tick of each type will be active at any time.

=item -Y I<label>

Sets the tag used in the multiplexor's syslog messages to
I<label> instead of C<mailmunge-multiplexor>.

=item -G

Normally, C<mailmunge-multiplexor> uses a umask of 027 when
creating listening sockets.  If you would like the sockets to be
readable and writeable by the group as well as the owner,
supply the C<-G> option.  This causes the umask to be 007
whenever UNIX-domain sockets are created.

=item -y I<n>

Limits the maximum number of concurrent C<recipok> checks
to I<n> on a per-domain basis.  The value of I<n> can range
from 0 (in which case no limit is applied) to I<maxWorkers>, where
I<maxWorkers> is the argument to the C<-x> option.  If I<n> is
outside that range, it is ignored (and no limit is applied.)

The C<recipok> command ultimately invokes the C<filter_recipient>
function in your filter.  If you are doing recipient verification against
servers that may be slow or unreliable, you can use the C<-y> option
to limit the number of concurrent recipient verifications per domain.
That way, if one domain's server becomes very slow, it won't consume
all available workers for recipient verification.  Instead, its
RCPT commands will be tempfailed and there will be workers available
to handle RCPT commands for other domains.

=back

=head1 SOCKET SPECIFICATION

The C<-a>, C<-N> and C<-O> options take a socket as an
argument.  This socket can be specified as:

=over

=item /path/to/socket

A UNIX-domain socket

=item inet:portnum

A TCP socket bound to port I<portnum>, but that accepts connections
only from the IPv4 loopback address (127.0.0.1).

=item inet_any:portnum

A TCP socket bound to port I<portnum> that will accept connections
from any address.  I<Use inet_any with caution!>

=item inet6:portnum

A TCP socket bound to port I<portnum> listening on the IPv6 loopback
address.

=item inet6_any:portnum

A TCP socket bound to port I<portnum> listening on the IPv6 wildcard
address.

=back

=head1 QUEUEING REQUESTS

Normally, if all workers are busy, any additional requests are failed
immediately.  However, the C<-q> and C<-Q> options allow you
to queue requests for a short amount of time.  This facility is intended
to gracefully handle a temporary overload; most of the time, your queue
should be empty.

Because C<mailmunge> checks the number of free workers when a
connection is opened and fails the connection if there are no free
workers, the intent of the queue is to allow SMTP transactions that are
already underway to continue if there is a slight overload.  Any new
connections will be failed if all workers are busy, but existing
connections are allowed to continue.  Queuing requests may improve
throughput on extremely busy servers.

Note that if you supply the C<-q> option to C<mailmunge>, then
even new connections are allowed to queue.  This may improve throughput by
keeping the worker utilization higher.

The C<-R> option to C<mailmunge> can be used to reserve a
specified number of workers for connections from the loopback address.  Using
the C<-R> option has the side-effect of permitting new connections
from the loopback address to queue.

=head1 EMBEDDING PERL

Normally, when C<mailmunge-multiplexor> activates a worker, it forks
and execs your Perl filter program.  However, if the multiplexor was
compiled with embedded Perl support, and you supply the C<-E>
command-line option, the multiplexor works like this:

=over

=item 1

It creates an embedded Perl interpreter, and sources your Perl filter program
with a special command-line argument telling it to read the filter, but
not to enter the main loop.

=item 2

Each time a worker is activated, the multiplexor calls fork() and calls the
Perl function C<_mailmunge_do_main_loop>.  This invokes C<filter_initialize>
and then runs your filter's main loop.

=back

On some very old platforms (for example, Red Hat Linux 7.3 with Perl
5.6.1), it is not safe to destroy and recreate a Perl interpreter
without causing a memory leak.  On those platforms, if you attempt to
reread the filter file (by sending the multiplexor a HUP signal or
reread command), the filter will I<not> be re-read, and a message will
be logged to syslog.  On those platforms, you must kill and restart
C<mailmunge-multiplexor> if you change the filter file.

On most platforms, however, a filter reread is accomplished by destroying
and re-creating the embedded interpreter, re-sourcing your Perl filter
and killing workers as soon as they are idle.

=head1 STATISTICS

With the C<-t> option, C<mailmunge-multiplexor> logs certain
events to a file.  This file can be post-processed to gather statistics
about the multiplexor.  You can use it to tune the number of workers
you run, adjust timeouts, and so on.

Each line of the file looks like this:

C<YYYY/MM/DD:HH:MM:SS timestamp event key=val key=val...>

Here, YYYY/MM/DD:HH:MM:SS is the local time of day.  Timestamp is
the number of seconds since January 1, 1970.  Event is the name
of an event.  The valid events are:

=over

=item StartWorker

A worker process has been started.

=item KillWorker

A worker process has been killed.

=item ReapWorker

A dead worker process has been reaped.  It is possible to have a ReapWorker
event without a previous KillWorker event if the worker process terminated
abnormally.

=item StartFilter

A worker process has begun filtering an e-mail message.

=item EndFilter

A worker process has finished filtering an e-mail message.

=back

The possible keys in the key=value pairs are:

=over

=item worker=I<n>

The worker involved in the event.  Every worker is identified by a small
integer.

=item nworkers=I<n>

The total number of running workers immediately after the event happened.

=item nbusy=I<n>

The number of busy workers (workers that are processing an e-mail message)
immediately after the event happened.

=item reason="I<string>"

The reason for a StartWorker or KillWorker event.  (Present only for these
events.)

=item numRequests=I<n>

The number of e-mails processed by the worker.  Present only for an
EndFilter event.

=back

If you send the C<mailmunge-multiplexor> process a SIGHUP signal (kill
-1 I<pid>), it closes and reopens the statistics file.  This is useful
during log file rotation.

If you send the C<mailmunge-multiplexor> process a SIGINT signal (kill
-INT I<pid>), it terminates all active-but-idle workers.  Also, any
active-and-busy workers terminate as soon as they finish filtering the
current message.  This is useful to force a reread of the filter rules
file without stopping and restarting Sendmail.

If you send the C<mailmunge-multiplexor> process a SIGTERM signal
(kill I<pid>), it terminates all workers and exits immediately.
